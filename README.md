# User Story
Page where the end-user can pick css colours and make a list of favorite's.

##### Details
The big rectangle is meant to be a preview of the colour that you have typed into the text box above it. 

### Steps:

- Make a function to set the colour of this area.
- Make the input box set the colour. 


### Hints
> We write colour in English, but Americans spell it color. CSS uses the American spelling, and it wonâ€™t work if you write colour instead.
