# Color picker

## User Story
Page where the end-user can pick css colours and make a list of favorite's.
- The big rectangle is meant to be a preview of the colour that you have typed into the text box above it. 


> We write colour in English, but Americans spell it color. CSS uses the American spelling, and it wonâ€™t work if you write colour instead.
